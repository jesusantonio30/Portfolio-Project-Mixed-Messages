## Create a rough draft of how the program will operate.

    1. Create a function that generates a random quote when called
    + Create an array that stores quotes
    + Array will contain 10 elements from 0 - 9
    + Use Math.random * array.length to generate a random number between 0 and 9, wrap this using Math.floor to round down
    + Using the generated number, wrap it around [] to access the index
